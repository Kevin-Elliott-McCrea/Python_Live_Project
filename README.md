Overview: 
Since the beginning of this bootcamp, I have been going through tutorials and mostly working on understanding and duplicating what is explained to me. That was essential to my future in computer programming, but I wasn't genuinely challenged to create something on my own with minimal support. This project acted as that challenge to bring the skills I have learned into a realistic simulation of the software dev working environment.

We used Azure DevOps to manage workflow and repos, which taught me a tremendous amount about how to manage communication with my team, push and pull requests, linking documents as well as making concise statements about what I changed in my commits. This process taught me the importance of vigilant awareness while merging and comparing branches and always double checking which branch you have checked out. My ability to write code has improved quite a bit during the course of the project, but more importantly than that, 
I have developed a strong mentality to persist and solve the problem in the face of the inevitable frustration of --- is the number one skill to have in producing functional code.

Here are segments of the code I wrote that highlight my accomplishments:
